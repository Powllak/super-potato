         <ul id="left">

            <li class="hidden">- My favorite color is orange. -</li><br></br>

            <li class="hidden">- I dream a lot with my eyes open, like i literally disappear into my own mind for a few seconds several times a day 
                (whether this is a problem or normal i have no idea but i have a lot of fun). -</li><br></br>
        
            <li class="hidden">- Music in general it's one of my great passions in life. -</li><br></br>

            <li class="hidden">- I procrastinate a lot, unfortunately. That's why I'm making this website and not music. - </li><br></br>

            <li class="hidden">- I grew up in a region of Brazil called Região 5. Who knows knows.. -</li><br></br>
            
            <li class="hidden">- It looks like I know what I'm doing but it's all a lie. -</li><br></br>

        <h1  id="bigger-3">When I decided to create this site with the look of <a id ="winnie-the-pooh-4"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koCytQkK76s" target="_blank">Winnie the Pooh</a> 
        I remembered that I have a photo of me as a baby riding a tiger.</h1>
        <br></br><br></br>
            <p class ="hidden" id="bigger-4">Not a real tiger, obviously. Unless I grew up in Oklahoma, in the United States, in a right-wing family in the early 2000s, 
                who took me to visit the bizarre Tiger King Zoo. But it's not my case.</p>
            <p class ="hidden" id="bigger-5">And I think it's Tigger from the cartoon.
            Because if it was just a symbolic big cat, it would have to be a jaguar. In Brazil we don't have tigers.</p>
            <br></br><br></br>

            <br></br>
            <p class ="hidden" id="bigger-4">And if you look closely, you'll notice that the photo shows signs of who would know how to hold a cigarette properly in the future.
            Which means nothing because these days I don't smoke. OK, mom?</p>
            
        <br></br><br></br><br></br>
        <h1  id="bigger-6">I talked about the things I like, but one of the things I hate the most is motivational quotes. 
        Or things related to mental coaching.</h1>
        <br></br><br></br>

            <p class ="hidden" id="bigger-7"><em>"Study while others are sleeping; work while others are loafing; prepare while others are playing;

            <p class ="hidden" id="bigger-11">If that instinctive drive for honey to satisfy his hunger is what drives him to many of his great innovations, I would say that I have a similar hunger, but for wine. I even created this site over a few glasses of wine. It's not great or innovative but it's something. (I swear I'm not an alcoholic, it's a hobby). 
            And of course, the tummy and a mutual friend, as I showed in my baby photo.</p>
